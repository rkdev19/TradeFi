# TenderFi – A Demo Auction Platform for Government Tenders

**TenderFi** is a demonstration platform built to showcase the potential of [**TradeFi**](https://github.com/rkdev19/TradeFi/tree/DEMO), a lightweight module designed for creating and managing auction-based marketplaces on the Algorand blockchain.

## 🌐 What is TenderFi?

TenderFi simulates a government tendering system using blockchain-based auctions. It visually demonstrates how public procurement can become:

- Transparent  
- Decentralized  
- Tamper-proof  

## 🎯 Purpose of the Demo

This platform is not meant for production use. It is a **concept demo** to show how easily **TradeFi** can be integrated into a frontend app to:

- Create tenders (auctions)
- Allow vendors to place bids
- Select the lowest valid bid
- Record everything securely on-chain

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Traditional tendering often faces issues like lack of visibility, favoritism, or disputes. By moving the process to the blockchain using TradeFi:

- Every bid is public and verifiable  
- No custom backend is required  
- Results are fair and auditable by default  

## 🔗 How It Works

TenderFi connects to the Algorand TestNet and uses TradeFi’s simple functions behind the scenes:
- `createAuction()` to post a tender  
- `placeBid()` for vendor bidding  
- `finalizeAuction()` to close and verify  
- `acceptBid()` to select a winner  

## 📁 Project Status

This is a **frontend-only demo** designed to illustrate TradeFi's use in real-world scenarios.
